# Comet app web site

[Comet](https://github.com/small-tech/comet) is a little Git commit message editor for elementary OS.

This basic one-page site is generated from Cometâ€™s app metadata.

It features:

  - App name
  - App description
  - Screenshots (in progressively-enhanced, accessible carousel)
  - Install button
  - Links to Help, Issues, and Funding

In addition, it contains [a signed Flatpak repository with static deltas](https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2017/02/10/maintaining-a-flatpak-repository/). The Install button links to the latest stable release of Comet from this repository.

__Work in progress:__ Running the `task/publish` script from any elementary OS app generated from [Watson](https://github.com/small-tech/watson) will result in such a web site.
